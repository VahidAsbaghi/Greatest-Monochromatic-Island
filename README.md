# Greatest-Monochromatic-Island
Finding a Greatest Monochromatic Island is a complex problem in Computational Geometry.

I solve the problem using two methods. First one is a Genetic Algorithm to find an optimal solution. And the second one is Triangulation technique to find the solution. 

All codes are written in MATLAB 2013 environment and a GUI is provided.

The Gui file is GUI_Island.m
